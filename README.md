# 60W Constant Current Electronic Load Capture Serial Data

A simple Node.js script to capture serial data from a cheap 60W Constant Current Electronic Load


## Instructions
1. Connect your USB serial adapter as following:

2. Clone this repository

3. Run `npm install` (make sure that you have Node.js installed on your system)
4. Customize your COM port directly on the script (edit `index.js` file)
5. Run `npm start` to start capturing data

6. Stop the script execution to analyse the captured CSV file (NOTE: by default the CSV uses the ';' character as a separator because it's the Excel default on my system)

## Requirements
- USB serial adapter (5V logic level)
- Node.js and NPM/Yarn installed (can run basically on every system)
- 60W Constant Current Electronic Load ( You can buy one from China or Amazon: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Constant-Current-Electronic-Battery-Capacity/dp/B01N95NSSP )

## Motivation and History
I quickly wrote this script because I needed to plot the data (voltage over time) from my Constant Current Electronic Load module. I've tried some solutions like some terminal software but I couldn't found free software that plots the data with the timestamp.
This is a very simple and raw code, so you need to directly edit the script file to customize your options. I only shared this code, because the serial adapter connection instructions can be useful for someone.
